Brief context 
Lieferando is Germany’s leading food-delivery company. We connect partners (restaurants, grocery stores, retail businesses) with consumers, with the ambition to deliver everyday convenience to our customers. 
They have two types of operating models: 
  ● Marketplace: The partner delivers the order themselves. Lieferando acts as a marketplace, where the customer places the order through our app or website. We receive a commission for the order. 
  ● Logistics/Delivery: The order is placed through JET, but we also complete the delivery ourselves through our Scoober Logistics business. We receive higher commission, but incur delivery costs.
